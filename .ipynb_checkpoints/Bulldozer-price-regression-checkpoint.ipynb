    "# Forecasting Bulldozer Prices with Machine Learning ðŸšœ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project to use the characteristics of bulldozers and their past sales prices to predict the sale price of future bulldozers based on their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inputs:** Bulldozer characteristics such as make year, base model, model series, state of sale (e.g. which US state was it sold in), drive system and more.\n",
    "* **Outputs:** Bulldozer sale price (in USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since we're going to predicting results with a time component (predicting future sales based on past sales), this is also known as a **time series** or **forecasting** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques used in here have been inspired and adapted from [the fast.ai machine learning course](https://course18.fast.ai/ml).\n"

    "Looking at the [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) we see that it contains historical sales data of bulldozers. Including things like, model type, size, sale date and more.\n",

    "1. **Train.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011 (close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including `SalePrice` which is the **target variable**).\n",
    "2. **Valid.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012 (close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as **Train.csv**).\n",
    "3. **Test.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the `SalePrice` attribute, as this is what we'll be trying to predict)."

    "### 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, [Kaggle has set the evaluation metric to being root mean squared log error (RMSLE)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation). As with many regression evaluations, the goal will be to get this value as low as possible (a low error value means our model's predictions are close to what the real values are).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how well our model is doing, we'll calculate the RMSLE and then compare our results to others on the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Note`**: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE."
